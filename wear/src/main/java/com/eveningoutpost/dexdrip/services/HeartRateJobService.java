/**
 * Due to a critical bug in Android Wear 8.x affecting at least the Huawei Watch 2
 * where background process limits are applied to apk's which do not target sdk 26 or above
 * and where the activity IS visible and where no user settings have been applied to restrict
 * access. This is the exact opposite behavior described in the Android reference documentation.
 *
 * The service is terminated silently, invisibly bringing down the entire app every 30 seconds
 * causing massive power drain and corruption potential. This very significantly harms user
 * experience and is a huge regression in the framework.
 *
 * This class attempts to work around the issue.
