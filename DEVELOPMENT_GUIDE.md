# xDrip Development Guide
The following steps describe how to set up a development environment required to build xDrip.
- Fork [NightscoutFoundation/xDrip](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip) on GitHub.
- Download, install, and launch the latest Android Studio from [Android Studio Official Site](https://developer.android.com/studio).
- In the startup menu, click `Get from VCS`.
- Select GitHub in the left panel, then click `Log In via GitHub...`.
- Click `Authorize in GitHub` on the newly opened page.
- You should now see a list of your GitHub projects, including the newly forked `xDrip`. Select it and click `Clone`.
- You may encounter an `Unsupported Java` error. To build xDrip, use an older JDK version:
  - Open the following menu: *File* -> *Settings* -> *Build, Execution, Deployment* -> *Build Tools* -> *Gradle*.
  - In the `Gradle JDK` dropdown, select `Download JDK...`.
  - For `Version:`, select `11`; leave the remaining options unchanged.
  - Click `Download`, then click `Apply`.
  - Close the settings window.
  - Restart Android Studio.

You should now be able to build xDrip and run it in an emulator or deploy it to a physical device.
