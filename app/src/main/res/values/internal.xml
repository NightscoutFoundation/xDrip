    <string name="import_db_warning">
        WARNING: Restoring a database might cause SEVERE DATA LOSS. If you don\'t know why you want to use the restore, don\'t use it.
        In regular operation of xDrip it is not needed. Just use it in case of previous data loss.
        If you are not sure what to do, in case you still want to use the restore, please ask an expert user.\n\n
        Instructions:\n
        Place the database you want to install in the directory \'xdrip\' on your primary external storage
        (sometimes called \'internal storage\' by the file browser).
        It is the same directory xDrip exports to.\n
        In case you have a zipped export in this directory, unzip it (usually longpress->extract on the file in the file browser).
        If it gets extracted to a subdirectory it will still be found by the restore.\n\n
        After having placed the file, start this restore routine.
        Scroll to the correct database name, click on it and follow the instructions on the screen.  \n\n
        ATTENTION: A Database can only be restored if it has the same database version number currently needed for this xDrip version.
        The database verions number may change with xDrip updates.
        It is best to restore the database with the same version of the xDrip app it was exported and then update xDrip.
