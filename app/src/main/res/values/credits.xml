<!--    These translators credited here provided translation via the in-app translation feature.
        Later during the project, this feature was retired and cloud based translation was used with
        many additional contributors who are not individually recognized within the application.

        In June 2021 the credits for these translators was removed from the main display due to
        the data being outdated vs the current state of how translation is handled.

        For historical record this file remains.
