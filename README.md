### Thoughts or Questions?
* ask me questions in the issuse, I wont mind, I prommise!
* That thing Im doing looks dumb? Thats because I dont know anything about java, I did a lot of things to make it do what I want that Im sure are not correct
* Why do you not use camel casing all the time? Because I didnt know that was a thing until I was halfway into this project, I really dont know java
* So why are these activities and not fragments? Because I also didnt know those were things until I was halfway in
