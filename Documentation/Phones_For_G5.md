# Smart Watches which have achieved high capture rate

An Android Wear watch can also act as a G5 collector. This can be a good way to get around problems with a phone's bluetooth stack without needing to change phones.

The following watch models have reported getting a capture rate of 90%-100%

Watch Model | Mode | Patched
--- | --- | ---
Sony SmartWatch 3 |
Asus ZenWatch 2 | OB1 | Yes
Asus ZenWatch 3 | OB1 | Yes
Huawei Watch | OB1 | Yes
LG G Watch | OB1 | Yes
Polar M600 | OB1 | Yes

Only the Sony SmartWatch 3 works without patching at the moment. Other listed models require the rom to be patched to work correctly.
