# Reporting Issues with xDrip

Before opening an issue, please communicate with us by posting in "Discussions":  
https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/discussions
We will encourage you to open an issue if it is not already known and there is no work-around.  

### Please provide as much information as possible when communicating your concerns with us:

* If it is a bug, please try to explain how to reproduce it, roughly which settings you are using, what you are seeing or not seeing. Screenshots welcomed.
* If it relates to a new feature, please explain the rationale for the feature, use cases and detail your suggestion.  

# Contributing patches to xDrip

### Do you have an idea for a feature or enhancement or bugfix for Nightscout xDrip?

Patches are welcomed! To ensure the best all round results they need be a good fit with the project roadmap, the ecosystem of users and respect overall project stability and good practice.

The best way to get patches accepted is to discuss your ideas with project maintainers using [Discussions](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/discussions) prior to implementation and discuss how to structure things so that they can fit well within the project and also the rationale for the change.

#### Project reviewers are likely to use criteria similar to that outlined below:

* Does the patch affect any existing functionality? What is the impact of the change?
* Does the patch enhance the app in a way which is proportional to the change being made?
* Can any significant behavioral change be controlled with a settings switch without excessively increasing the user interface complexity?
* Is there an existing maintainer working on the affected area with possibly parallel activity?
* Are there any other potential negative consequences to the change?
* Does the patch contain any unrelated changes?
* Has the patch been properly tested?

Make sure any pull request has a clear title and a good description.

Try not to bundle different patches together and keep the change set to the minimum required. Even unrelated changes to whitespace have to be reviewed in case a random keystroke broke something. The less lines there are to review, the clearer the patch will be to any reviewer.

Maintainers are not always immediately aware of pull request submissions, which is another reason why it helps to have discussed your work prior to submission. Feel free to ask about the progress of processing your PR as maintainers may not realise a PR is awaiting action.
